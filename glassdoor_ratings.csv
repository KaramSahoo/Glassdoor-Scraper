23 Jan 2022 ,Anonymous,Premise falls short,"Product is conceptually interesting. Interesting clients on the security side and projects with no shortage of problems to solve. Premise is filled with smart and interesting people. The people on the customer-side of this organization are top notch. Talent is generally young. Unlimited PTO, but below-average benefits for the tech space. Work life balance is generally strong, this depends heavily on your team and the example set by your manager.","Nepotism is felt everywhere. The executive team is an underwhelming group, a ‘boy’s club,’ composed of former colleagues of the CEO. The CEO is mistrusted across the organization. There is a clear vacuum of leadership. Up to now, leadership has been unable to articulate a sales, growth, or engineering strategy. There is a clear vacuum of leadership, the only time the company at large hears from the CEO is to be scolded like school children. Working at Premise provides little personal or financial satisfaction. Limited-to-no opportunity for advancement or career progression, in large part because leadership favors personal relationships. Compensation is well below market pay. Company valuation and revenue is a mystery because there is no transparency from the top. Most employees do not execute the roles for which they were hired. As is typical at startups, employees are expected to work across the business and ‘do whatever needs to be done,’ rendering job descriptions and ownership of work or product areas meaningless. Who owns what piece of work is a mystery. Premise aspires to be a data collection company, but cannot manage its internal data or perform basic operations. Just look at their app and playstore reviews. The company’s failure to deliver on its most basic function (operating an app that pays contributors for the data and value they provide) becomes clear. Engineering teams consistently underperform. It seems most of their time is spent putting out fires caused by poor code and infrastructure, rather than developing or enhancing the product. Eng cannot and does not deploy regularly. As a result, the broader organization expects its failures and has begun investing heavily in third-party systems rather than developing the necessary tools and processes internally.",1.0,Not Recommended,Not Recommended,Not Recommended

8 Feb 2022 ,Anonymous,Flailing company stuffed with corporate politicians,"There are some good, smart, and well-intentioned people there who do truly care about the global consumers they help but that's about the extent of the Pros.","As mentioned by many others, politics and nepotism run rampant. Upper management only wants yes-men in their midst and avidly promotes for ""optimism"" rather than leadership skills and experience. The lack of diversity in upper management permeates throughout much of the org. The ""bro"" culture is strong in leadership as is within certain teams. Leadership regularly demonstrates elitist behaviors and lacks respect for the global app users. The CEO rarely makes appearances at all-hands, and refuses to divulge the company valuation or other key metrics normal in companies with transparency. As noted by another reviewer, when he does show up, it's to treat employees like school children, or to lay out thinly veiled legal threats. There is still a small pool of decent managers there who understand the true meaning of leadership, but that pool is rapidly shrinking. Instead, the management-favored hires brought on are a number of insecure, micromanaging yes-men. The most damaging are the loud voiced, narcissistic ones who think their strength is to assess situations quickly but dismally lack the self-awareness to realise gaps in experience and context. Unfortunately, same individual(s) are also hell-bent to impress, thereby often making ‘showy’, but lack-strategic direction, decisions that end with catastrophic results (also steals and inflates credit where none is theirs to take). Needless to say, politics abounds for visibility and jockeys to the most direct line to the CEO or COO is the modus operandi. This is a place for you if you enjoy brown-nosing and hot-dogging. HR switches up health plans every year touting new fertility benefits while completely ignoring the gaping lack of 401k match (it is far cheaper for a company to offer benefits that only a select few will utilise vs coughing up benefits that benefit everyone long term). The exuberant 5-star reviews are largely written by middle management and the starry-eyed-glad-to-have-a-job-in-a-tech-startup employees. The management-written gush-glowing reviews are trying to desperately recruit to boost their own hiring numbers. Also beware the exaggerated #data-for-good tag line that has been adopted by the company. The do-good is significantly far less than what the PR machine would like to have you believe. This is a Series E that is far more alike a Series A or B in terms of maturity. The founders, along with their vision, have left the company a long time ago. The company is led by a corporate-for-hire CEO and his lackeys. Unfortunately, too many 5-star reviews are written by folks who have never been in a good tech company before to realize what they got into. The company has long since lost its way.",2.0,Not Recommended,Moderate,Moderate

31 Jan 2022 , Product Manager ,No conscience or direction,"Like other reviews said there are smart people at Premise, but that’s about the only pro","There is no revenue or product strategy. As a result there is no product fit in the market. Product is clumsy and difficult to use, any attempts to ship a new feature takes months when it should take just a few weeks. The product itself is elitist, designed in Silicone valley for end users in developing countries. Premise does not factor in the experiences or cultures of its intended users in designing it’s product and writing tasks and surveys. It runs the same surveys everywhere from Afghanistan and Cambodia to the United States. No loyalty, but lots of fear. One wrong move and you have to worry they will send you packing. I suspect the five star reviews you see hear were typed out of fear and a desire to make the company seem legit. If you’re thinking about working here, think very hard about your values and make sure that your team shares them. There’s also no loyalty to contributors since Premise is not able to reliably ensure user safety or pay users. The business is flailing. From layoffs and firings without cause and reducing payments for contributors, it’s crystal clear that the company needs serious help.",2.0,Not Recommended,Not Recommended,Not Recommended
